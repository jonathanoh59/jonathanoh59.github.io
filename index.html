      <article class="about-me-introduction">
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Jonathan. I am a 25 year-old Glasweigan currently
          living in Manchester. Many elements of my childhood inspired the path
          I took in life; from early as I can remember, I have been fascinated
          by cars and technology. Countless hours playing with model cars and
          reading up on the latest car specs was the basis of it all. The
          premise of iterating designs, components and features to improve on
          what originated, struck me deeply. It was this that led me to studying
          Mechanical Engineering (MEng) at Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh and
          later graduate with Distinction. Using with software packages such as
          ANSYS, ABAQUS and MATLAB to complete projects, I developed an even
          stronger passion for fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduating, I spent several months upskilling while applying for
          positions in the Automotive Industry. As I had enjoyed using the
          softwares within many of my university projects, I decided to focus on
          this area; improving my coding abilities. I later joined FDM to gain
          experience in the Technology industry, where I developed more
          technical skills. While I trained as a Business Intelligence
          consultant, I learnt an array of new skills from SQL through to Data
          Warehousing Concepts and Business Intelligence reporting. To this day,
          I enjoy working with others and helping them meet and surpass their
          business goals. Being oriented on the outcome of projects, I believe I
          work tirelessly on projects to deliver high quality work. So far, my
          experience in the Technology sector has helped me gain confidence from
          the diverse range of work and people I have met along the way. I am
          proud of the work I have managed to contribute to so far, but I more
          excited about what is yet to come. Working in fast paced environments,
          in pressured situations, and toward deadlines help better me as a
          professional. I alway welcome development opportunities, regardless of
          the form it takes.
