    <h2>Who Is Jonathan?</h2>
    <article>
     <p>Hi there! My name is Jonathan. I am a 25 year-old Glasweigan currently living in Manchester. 
      Many elements of my childhood inspired the path I took in life; from early as I can remember, I have been fascinated by cars and technology. 
      Countless hours playing with model cars and reading up on the latest car specs was the basis of it all. 
      The premise of iterating designs, components and features to improve on what originated and to beat competitors, struck me deeply. 
      It was this that led me to studying Mechanical Engineering (MEng) at Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh and later graduate with Distinction. 
      Using with software packages such as ANSYS, ABAQUS and MATLAB to complete projects, I developed an even stronger passion for fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. 
      
      After graduating, I spent several months upskilling while applying for positions in the Automotive Industry. As I had enjoyed using the softwares within many of my university projects,
      I decided to focus on this area; improving my coding abilities. I later joined FDM to gain experience in the Technology industry, where I developed more technical skills. While I trained as a Business Intelligence consultant,
      I learnt an array of new skills from SQL through to Data Warehousing Concepts and Business Intelligence reporting. To this day, I enjoy working with others and helping them meet and surpass their business goals.
      Being oriented on the outcome of projects, I believe I work tirelessly on projects to deliver high quality work. So far, my experience in the Technology sector has helped me gain confidence from the diverse range of work and people I have met along the way.
      I am proud of the work I have managed to contribute to so far, but I more excited about what is yet to come. Working in fast paced environments, in pressured situations, and toward deadlines help better me as a professional. I alway welcome development opportunities, regardless of the form it takes.</P>
